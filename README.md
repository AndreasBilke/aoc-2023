# Advent of Code 2023

Last year I tried to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) the hard way by using it for [AoC puzzles 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

One year passed and I didn't wrote a single line of Rust after AoC, so it is time for learning Rust again at [AoC 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
